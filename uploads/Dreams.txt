I Am Poem
Dreams
I am hopefull and dreamy
I wonder how fluffy the clouds are in that big blue sky
I hear how the moon speaks to me
I See little lights dancing in the rain
I want to run free with the wind
I am hopefull and dreamy
I pretend to be one with the nature
I feel how the trees stare at me
I touch and feel the history of water
I worry that someday I will lose me imagination
I cry whenever I see a lost soul
I am hopefull and dreamy
I understand that everyone is different
I say to always listen to the voices in your head
I dream of seeing the world
I try to make everyone happy
I hope I never lose the real me
I am hopefull and dreamy
